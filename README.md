# Blood Runner
A game made to simplify learning about the circulatory system


To get started go to the releases tab and download the zip file that says source code

If you have a windowcs computer now would be a good time to download python3 from python.org
If you have a mac made in the last 5 years you should have it preinstalled but it wouldn't hurt to check

Once the zip file has downlaoded unzip it 
Then simply right click blood_runner.py and select open with/python3
If you do not see this option right click (in the file explorer) and hit open in termianal
Once in terminal type "python3 blood_runner.py"

If this does not work for you then you probably don't have python3 installed/setup properly
